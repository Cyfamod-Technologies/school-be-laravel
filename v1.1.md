# v1.1 – Academic Sessions & Terms
Description: Focused on creating, listing, editing, and deleting academic sessions and their linked terms with validation and feedback.

## v1.1 User Stories
- Admin creates academic sessions with name, start date, end date, sees validation errors (e.g., overlap/required), and can list, edit, or delete sessions with success/failure alerts; delete respects backend constraints (`/v11/add-session`, `/v11/all-sessions`, `/v11/edit-session`).
- Admin creates academic terms linked to a session with name (1st/2nd/3rd), start date, end date, validates required fields and allowed names, lists terms per session, and edits/deletes with clear feedback; delete respects backend constraints (`/v11/add-term`, `/v11/all-terms`, `/v11/edit-term`).
