# v1.4 – Student Management & Skills
Description: Covers student CRUD, listings, skills/term comments, result PINs, result printing, and class skill ratings.

## v1.4 User Stories
- Admin manages students: add/edit detailed profiles (demographics, class/arm/section, session/term, parent, blood group, optional photo), with validation and error feedback (`/v14/add-student`, `/v14/edit-student`).
- Admin lists and filters students by session/class/arm/section, searches, sorts, paginates, and can view or edit from the table (`/v14/all-students`).
- Admin views a student profile with full details, deletes a student, and prints the student result for a chosen session/term (`/v14/student-details`).
- Admin records per-student skill ratings (1–5) per session/term, edits/deletes ratings, and uses available skill types; saves teacher/principal term comments for the selected context (`/v14/student-details`).
- Admin manages student result PINs for a selected session/term: generate/regenerate, invalidate, show, and view PIN status/history (`/v14/student-details`).
- Admin checks a student result by selecting session/term/class/arm/student and opens the printable slip (`/v14/check-result`).
- Admin bulk-prints class results for a selected session/term/class with optional autoprint flag (`/v14/bulk-results`).
- Admin bulk rates class skills: load students by session/term/class, pick a skill, enter ratings grid, and save all (`/v14/class-skill-ratings`).
- Admin uses dependent dropdowns (class → arm → section) for troubleshooting (`/v14/test-dropdown-debug`).
