# v2.6 – Student Portal Login & Result Download
Description: Covers student login, session handling, profile fetch, and printable result download with user-friendly errors.

## v2.6 User Stories
- Student signs in to the result portal with admission number and password, sees validation/errors, and can use demo credentials when enabled (`/student-login`).
- Student session token is stored for subsequent requests; logout clears the student session (`/student-login`, student auth utilities).
- Student downloads printable result by session/term via the student download route, with clear error pages for missing filters, permission issues, or unavailable results (`/student/print-result/route.ts`).
- Student profile can be fetched after login for portal context (school, class, parent, subjects) via student auth utilities.
