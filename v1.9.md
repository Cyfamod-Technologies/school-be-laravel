# v1.9 – Results, PINs, Components, Grading & Skills
Description: Focuses on result PIN management, bulk result entry, assessment components, grading scales, and skill category/type management.

## v1.9 User Stories
- Admin manages result PINs: load PINs by session/term/class/arm/student, generate or regenerate single PINs, bulk-generate PINs for a class, set expiry/max usage, show PIN, invalidate PINs, and print scratch cards (`/v19/pins`).
- Admin performs result entry in bulk: load students by session/term/class/arm/section/subject/component, view existing scores, enter/update scores with validation against component weight, and save batch results with status feedback (`/v19/results-entry`).
- Admin manages assessment components: list/filter/paginate components, create/edit with name/score/order/label and subject associations, select/deselect subjects (including select all), and delete components (`/v19/assessment-components`).
- Admin manages grading scales: select an active scale, add/edit/delete grade ranges (label, min/max score, optional grade point, description) with row validation and save changes (`/v19/grade-scales`).
- Admin manages skills & behaviour: list skill categories and skills, create/edit/delete categories and skills (with optional weight/description), and refresh lists (`/v19/skills`).
