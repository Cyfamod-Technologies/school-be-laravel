# v1.0 – School Onboarding & Admin Login
Description: Covers initial school registration, admin authentication, and viewing/updating the single-school profile and admin account.

## v1.0 User Stories
- Admin self-registers a school by providing school name, email, address, subdomain, and admin password; sees success banner and optional email verification prompt (`/register`).
- Admin logs in with email and password; invalid input shows friendly errors, next-redirect respected, dashboard/profile loaded on success, and session persists until logout (`/login`).
- Admin can trigger “Forgot Password?” from the login form after entering a valid email to request a reset link (`/login`).
- Admin views the school profile with logo/signature, name, address, email, phone, and current session/term; can refresh data (`/v10/profile`).
- Admin updates school profile (name, email, phone, address, session/term, logo, signature add/remove) and sees immediate reflection on profile page (`/v10/edit-school-profile`).
- Admin updates their own account details (name, email, password) with validation and friendly errors (`/v10/edit-admin-profile`).
